                <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">Red is the color of fire and blood, so it is associated with energy, war,
                    danger, strength,
                    power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love.
                    Red is a very emotionally intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration
                    rate, and raises blood pressure. It has very high visibility, which is why stop signs,
                    stoplights, and fire equipment are usually painted red. In heraldry, red is used to indicate
                    courage. It is a color found in many national flags.
                    Red brings text and images to the foreground. Use it as an accent color to stimulate people to
                    make quick decisions; it is a perfect color for 'Buy Now' or 'Click Here' buttons on Internet
                    banners and websites. In advertising, red is often used to evoke erotic feelings (red lips, red
                    nails, red-light districts, 'Lady in Red', etc). Red is widely used to indicate danger (high
                    voltage signs, traffic lights). This color is also commonly associated with energy, so you can
                    use it when promoting energy drinks, games, cars, items related to sports and high physical
                    activity.

                    sunshine, and the tropics. Orange represents enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity,
                    determination, attraction, success, encouragement, and stimulation.
                    To the human eye, orange is a very hot color, so it gives the sensation of heat. Nevertheless,
                    orange is not as aggressive as red. Orange increases oxygen supply to the brain, produces an
                    invigorating effect, and stimulates mental activity. It is highly accepted among young people.
                    As a citrus color, orange is associated with healthy food and stimulates appetite. Orange is the
                    color of fall and harvest. In heraldry, orange is symbolic of strength and endurance.
                    Orange has very high visibility, so you can use it to catch attention and highlight the most
                    important elements of your design. Orange is very effective for promoting food products and
                    toys.
                    Dark orange can mean deceit and distrust. Red-orange corresponds to desire, sexual passion,
                    pleasure, domination, aggression, and thirst for action. Gold evokes the feeling of prestige.

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">Yellow is the color of sunshine. It's associated with joy, happiness,
                    intellect, and energy.
                    Yellow produces a warming effect, arouses cheerfulness, stimulates mental activity, and
                    generates muscle energy. Yellow is often associated with food. Bright, pure yellow is an
                    attention getter, which is the reason taxicabs are painted this color. When overused, yellow may
                    have a disturbing effect; it is known that babies cry more in yellow rooms. Yellow is seen
                    before other colors when placed against black; this combination is often used to issue a
                    warning. In heraldry, yellow indicates honor and loyalty. Later the meaning of yellow was
                    connected with cowardice.

                    products and items related to leisure. Yellow is very effective for attracting attention, so use
                    it to highlight the most important elements of your design. Men usually perceive yellow as a
                    very lighthearted, 'childish' color, so it is not recommended to use yellow when selling
                    prestigious, expensive products to men â€“ nobody will buy a yellow business suit or a yellow
                    Mercedes. Yellow is an unstable and spontaneous color, so avoid using yellow if you want to
                    suggest stability and safety. Light yellow tends to disappear into white, so it usually needs a
                    dark color to highlight it. Shades of yellow are visually unappealing because they loose
                    cheerfulness and become dingy.
                    Dull (dingy) yellow represents caution, decay, sickness, and jealousy.Light yellow is associated
                    with intellect, freshness, and joy.

                    Black is a mysterious color associated with fear and the unknown (black holes). It usually has a
                    negative connotation (blacklist, black humor, 'black death'). Black denotes strength and
                    authority; it is considered to be a very formal, elegant, and prestigious color (black tie,
                    black Mercedes). In heraldry, black is the symbol of grief.
                    Black gives the feeling of perspective and depth, but a black background diminishes readability.
                    A black suit or dress can make you look thinner. When designing for a gallery of art or
                    photography, you can use a black or gray background to make the other colors stand out. Black
                    contrasts well with bright colors. Combined with red or orange â€“ other very powerful colors â€“
                    black gives a very aggressive color scheme
